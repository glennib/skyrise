#Skyrise Web Data Display

This folder contains code/scripts for displaying flight data live on the web. I've tried to comment in my code to allow for readability :)

Ambitions for the web frontend:
* Will show all current balloon data during flight
* Will include Google Maps/Earth presentation of flight path
* Will enable the user to look at graphs showing how the data changes during the flight
* Will be a Wordpress Plugin
